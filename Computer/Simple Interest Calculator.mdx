# Simple Interest Calculator

This program calculates simple interest based on principal, rate, and time. Note that using integers for these values might lose precision in the interest calculation.

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="simpleInterestCalculator.py"
code={`
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
return (principal * rate * time) // 100 # Use integer division

principal = int(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = int(input("Enter the annual interest rate: "))
time = int(input("Enter the time in years: "))

interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
`}
/>
