# Average of Numbers Calculator

This program calculates the average of a list of numbers. Using integers will result in an integer average (floor division).

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="averageCalculator.py"
code={`
num_str = input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = [int(x) for x in num_str.split()]

average = 0
if numbers:  # Check if the list is not empty
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)  # Calculate average directly

print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
`}
