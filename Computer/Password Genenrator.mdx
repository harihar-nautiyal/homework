# Password Generator
This program generates password by performing some ascii calculations.

<CodeBlock
        language="python"
        filename="guessingGame.py"
        code={`def generate_password(length=12):\n    import random\n    import string\n    min_length = 8\n    if length < min_length:\n        length = min_length\n\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\n    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))\n    return password\n\npassword = generate_password()\nprint(f\"Generated password: {password}\")`}
