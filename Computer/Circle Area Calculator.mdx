# Circle Area Calculator

This program calculates the area of a circle using math.pi. Note that using integers for radius might lead to less precise area calculations.

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="circleAreaCalculator.py"
code={
    `
radius = int(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area}")
`}
/>
