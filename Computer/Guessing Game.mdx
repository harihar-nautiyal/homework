# Guessing Game 
This program is simple and consists of generating a random number and matching it with the player's guess.

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="guessingGame.py"
code={"def guess_number():\n    import random\n    target = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Enter your guess: \"))\n            attempts += 1\n            \n            if guess < target:\n                print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n            elif guess > target:\n                print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed it in {attempts} attempts!\")\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")"}
