# Computer Holiday Homework
Computer holiday homework consist of 15 python programs

here are links to programs 

## Triangle Area Calculator
This program calculates area of triangle.

<CodeBlock
        language="python"
        filename="triangleAreaCalculator.py"
        code={
                `
                def calculate_triangle_area(base, height):
    """Calculates the area of a triangle."""
    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:
        return "Base and height must be positive values."
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    return area

base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

area = calculate_triangle_area(base, height)
print(f"The area of the triangle is: {area}")

import math

def triangle_area_heron(a, b, c):
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return "Invalid triangle sides."
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    return area

a = float(input("Enter side a: "))
b = float(input("Enter side b: "))
c = float(input("Enter side c: "))

area_heron = triangle_area_heron(a, b, c)
print(f"The area of the triangle (Heron's Formula) is: {area_heron}")`
        }
/>
      

##  Employee Salary Calculator
Employee Salary calculator calculated the salary of employee by deducting taxes.


<CodeBlock
        language="python"
        filename="employeeSalaryCalculator.py"
        code={`
        def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, deductions):
    """Calculates the net salary after tax and deductions."""

    if gross_salary < 0:
        return "Gross salary cannot be negative."

    tax_amount = gross_salary * (tax_rate / 100)
    net_salary = gross_salary - tax_amount - deductions
    return net_salary

gross_salary = float(input("Enter the gross salary: "))
tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (%): "))
deductions = float(input("Enter total deductions: "))

net_salary = calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, deductions)
print(f"The net salary is: {net_salary}")

# More advanced example with overtime:
def calculate_salary_with_overtime(hourly_rate, regular_hours, overtime_hours):
    regular_pay = hourly_rate * regular_hours
    overtime_pay = hourly_rate * 1.5 * overtime_hours # 1.5 for time and a half
    total_pay = regular_pay + overtime_pay
    return total_pay

hourly_rate = float(input("Enter hourly rate: "))
regular_hours = float(input("Enter regular hours worked: "))
overtime_hours = float(input("Enter overtime hours worked: "))

total_pay = calculate_salary_with_overtime(hourly_rate, regular_hours, overtime_hours)
print(f"Total pay with overtime: {total_pay}")
        `}
/>
