# Discount Calculator

This program calculates the discounted price after applying a discount percentage. Note that using integers here will perform integer division for the discount amount, which might not be accurate.

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="discountCalculator.py"
code={`try:\n    price = float(input(\"Enter the original price: \"))\n    discountPercentage = float(input(\"Enter the discount percentage: \"))\n    if price < 0 or discountPercentage < 0 or discountPercentage > 100:\n        raise ValueError(\"Price and discount percentage must be non-negative. Discount percentage must not exceed 100%.\")\n    discountAmount = (discountPercentage / 100) * price\n    discountedPrice = price - discountAmount\n    print(f\"The discounted price is: {discountedPrice}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")`}
