# Discount Calculator

This program calculates the discounted price after applying a discount percentage. Note that using integers here will perform integer division for the discount amount, which might not be accurate.

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="discountCalculator.py"
code={`
def calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_percentage):
discount_amount = (discount_percentage * original_price) // 100 # Integer division
return original_price - discount_amount

price = int(input("Enter the original price: "))
discount = int(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))
discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(price, discount)
print(f"The discounted price is: {discounted_price}")
`}
/>
