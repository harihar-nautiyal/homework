# Discount Calculator

This program calculates the discounted price after applying a discount percentage. Note that using integers here will perform integer division for the discount amount, which might not be accurate.

<CodeBlock
language="python"
filename="discountCalculator.py"
code={`
price = int(input("Enter the original price: "))
discount = int(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))
discountAmount = (price * discount)
deductedAmount = original_price - discount_amount
print("The discounted price is: ", deductedAmount)
`}
/>
